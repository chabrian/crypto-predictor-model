### Selected Topic: Cryptocurrency Predictor Model
We have selected our topic to be within the cryptocurrency space. We wanted to explore this area and decided to build a supervised learning model to take in historical pricing data and predict what the price of a given cryptocurrency will be at various points in the future. Multiple of our team members are interested in crypto and we decided to take our interests and take on a project that will be both fun and challenging as we look forward into the job hunt and life after the bootcamp.
